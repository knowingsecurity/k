    <strong>Anomaly Detection</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
    Finding critical incidents or abnormal incidents in organizations that are against the organization’s security policies is difficult now-a-days. The attacks are highly sophisticated and its detection and prevention mechanism are going to be difficult. Every organization maintains the logs in a separate centralized environment and its being processed by special SIEM or analytics software’s. Even though these frameworks unable to close the gap between the anomaly incident occurrences and detections. Machine learning in analytics and behavior based anomaly detection are helpful, it may cover more in detection but not completely. Machine learning also needs to be updated by large number of datasets means the possibility of attacks. May it fill the gap, and it should be continuously updated along with attack methodologies.

<p>
    I am here to learn and write the methodologies of attacks, and its
    detection with prevention techniques also.
</p>
<p>
    Here I classified the detection by target area, they are
</p>
<p>
    1) Anomaly detection in Hosts
</p>
<p>
    2) Anomaly detection in Network

    <strong>Anomaly detection in Hosts</strong>

    Here I considered the term “host” means a desktop or server whether it runs
    with any operating system.
